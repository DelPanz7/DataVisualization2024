# Introduction
Welcome to COMP4462 - Data Visualization 2024 Fall
This is the repository for all learning materials included in the labs. Since our lab structure changed a lot from previous years, here we create this new repository.

While the lectures are focused on the principles of data visualization, the tutorials will focus on how to use the tools to make visualizations in practice.
